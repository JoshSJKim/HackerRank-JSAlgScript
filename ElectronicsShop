// This is flawed because you cannot directly compare arrays using the '===' operator since arrays are reference types.
// Comparison checks for reference equality.
// It is more logical to check if the length of the array is '0', in other words empty.

// The above code works for most test cases, but it throws a runtime error.
// I guess it means that it needs to be optimized.
